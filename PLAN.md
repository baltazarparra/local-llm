## 🎓 Design Decisions

### Why These Choices?

**PyTorch over TensorFlow**: Better Hugging Face integration, more flexible
**FastAPI over Flask**: Modern async support, automatic OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation
**Rich over Click**: More powerful terminal formatting, better UX
**prompt-toolkit**: Industry standard for advanced CLI input (used by IPython)
**Environment variables**: 12-factor app methodology, easy containerization
**Streaming**: Better UX, shows progress, feels responsive

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Configuration First**: All settings via environment variables
3. **Multiple Interfaces**: Users choose their preferred interaction method
4. **Privacy First**: 100% local, no telemetry, no cloud calls
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, validation
6. **User Experience**: Beautiful UI, fast responses, helpful error messages

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **No Tests**: Zero test coverage (Phase 5 priority)
2. **No API Streaming**: HTTP API doesn't support SSE yet
3. **No Quantization**: Large models require full VRAM
4. **No Batch Processing**: One request at a time
5. **No Model Hot-Swap**: Must restart to change models
6. **No RAG**: No document retrieval capabilities

### Minor Issues

- Return type hints incomplete (parameters done)
- No pre-commit hooks configured
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No Docker images
