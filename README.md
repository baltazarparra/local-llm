## Personal Assistant with Memory

**Talk naturally with your AI assistant** , who remembers everything you've said and can provide context-aware responses and integrate with Google Calendar for event management.

## What You Need

Python 3.10 or newer. A GPU helps but isn't required. Models download automatically from Hugging Face (default is about 1.5GB). That's it.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install
# Run the optimized installation script
./scripts/install.sh

# or
# Install dependencies via pip
pip install --prefer-binary --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed -r requirements.txt
```

## Using It

**Personal Assistant:**
```bash
./assistant.sh
```

The assistant automatically saves all conversations, extracts metadata (people, topics, sentiment), retrieves relevant context when you ask questions, and integrates with Google Calendar for event management. See `ASSISTANT.md` for detailed documentation and `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for calendar integration setup.

## Features

- **Perfect Memory**: Never forget a conversation - everything is automatically saved and searchable
- **Context-Aware**: Retrieves relevant past conversations to provide informed responses
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically identifies people, topics, dates, sentiment, and categories
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Create events naturally with phrases like "schedule meeting tomorrow at 3pm"
- **Semantic Search**: Find past conversations using natural language queries
- **Timeline View**: Browse conversations chronologically by person or topic
- **Statistics**: Track your conversation patterns and engagement

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file to customize settings:
```
MODEL_ID=Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
USE_GPU=true
MAX_NEW_TOKENS=512
TEMPERATURE=0.7
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=credentials.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**pip install is very slow?**
- Use `uv` instead: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (often 10-100x faster)
- Use pip cache: `pip install --cache-dir ~/.cache/pip -r requirements.txt`
- Use `--prefer-binary` flag to avoid building from source
- PyTorch is large (~500MB-2GB). First install takes time, subsequent installs use cache
- For CPU-only systems, use PyTorch CPU build: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`

**Network timeouts or slow downloads?**
- Use a pip mirror: `pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt` (China)
- Increase pip timeout: `pip install --default-timeout=1000 -r requirements.txt`
- Check your internet connection and firewall settings

**Out of disk space?**
- PyTorch and dependencies need ~3-5GB free space
- Use pip cache cleanup: `pip cache purge` (then reinstall with cache)

**Permission errors?**
- Make sure virtual environment is activated: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Don't use `sudo` with pip in virtual environments

### Runtime Issues

**Out of memory?** Lower `MAX_NEW_TOKENS` or try `USE_GPU=false`

**Very slow?** You're probably on CPU. GPU is much faster.

**Script won't run?** Make it executable: `chmod +x assistant.sh`

**Google Calendar not working?** See `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions
